package xds

// The ingest producers re-serialize received resources with protojson, which
// resolves every google.protobuf.Any body against the global proto registry.
// A type registers by linking its generated package, so the imports below pin
// the extension protos that real management servers (envoy-gateway, istiod)
// embed in gateway configurations beyond the top-level resource types. An
// unregistered type surfaces as a loud per-resource error naming the missing
// type URL: extend the list when one appears.
